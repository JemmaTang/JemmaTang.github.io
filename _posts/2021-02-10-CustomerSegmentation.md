**What is Customer Segmentation?**

Customer segmentation divides customers into groups based on common characteristics to market to each group effectively and appropriately.

**Why do we need customer segmentation?**

When marketing for customers, we hope to implement different strategies for different customers, realize accurate targeting and obtain the maximum conversion rate. The precise premise to do so is customer relationship management(CRM), and the core of CRM is customer segmentation.

Customer segmentation allows marketers better to tailor their marketing efforts to various audience subsets. Different personalized services are carried out for different customer subsets, and limited resources are reasonably allocated to customers with different values to maximize benefits.

**RFM model**

In customer segmentation, the RFM model is a classic classification model. The model uses the three core dimensions - recency, frequency, and monetary to segment customer groups to analyze different groups' customer value.

With the help of e-commerce customer data, this article discusses how to use the K-means algorithm to segment customer groups, use the RFM model to analyze customer value after segmentation, and identify high-value customers.

In this project, I mainly hope to achieve the following three goals:
1. Segment customer groups with the help of e-commerce data.
2. Analyze the characteristics of different customer groups and compare the customer value of each segment group.
3. Formulate corresponding operation and marketing strategies for customers with different values.
